#### Q). What List Component Does ?

> **List Component** displays a list of items, it has two sub-components 
> - **WrappedSingleListitem** - for rendering individual list item and 
> - **WrappedListCompont**, - for rendering the whole list of items. <br><br>
> When any user clicks on a list item, the **handleClick** function is called with the item's index as an argument, which updates the selectedIndex state variable.<br><br>
> List component exports WrappedListComponent as a memoized component for improved performance.
> In other words we can say List component provides a reusable and flexible way to display a list of items with the ability to select and highlight individual items.
